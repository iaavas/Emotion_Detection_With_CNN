# Emotion Based Music Player

Welcome to the Emotion Based Music Player project, a sophisticated application utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for emotion detection. This project not only identifies emotions through the fer2013 dataset but also enhances user experience by dynamically playing music corresponding to the detected emotions.

## Datasets

### fer2013 Dataset

- **Description:** The fer2013 dataset serves as the backbone for training and testing the emotion detection model. It consists of facial expressions labeled with various emotions.
