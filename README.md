# Emotion Based Music Player

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for emotion detection using the fer2013 dataset and plays a music from the preclassified dataset.

## Dataset

The fer2013 dataset is used for training and testing the emotion detection model. You can download the dataset from the following link:

[fer2013 Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rOGkPf13u0-TaMMJxVA7QzL_igTJxScu/view?usp=sharing) - Excel file containing the fer2013 data.

The music dataset is used for playing music based on the emotion. You can download the dataset from the following link:

## How to Run

To test the trained model, use the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```
